Little wonder that the Thrilla in Manila (aka Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier III), tops TIME’s list of greatest ever fights. The pair entered the decisive third heavyweight fight at 1-1 and the searing Philippine heat made conditions as close to hell as was possible. From the start there was nothing humane about the way the pair went at each other. You feel that had it not been for the 15-round limit and, ultimately, Frazier’s trainer Eddie Futch throwing in the towel at the end of the 14th, they would still be boxing today.’ I want him, boss,’ screamed Frazier. Futch simply replied, ‘It’s all over. No one will forget what you did here today.’ As for Ali, in typically modest fashion, he described his opponent as, ‘the greatest fighter of all time, next to me.'",

That’s how you’d have to describe heavyweight champ Jack Dempsey’s defense of his title against Luis Angel Firpo, the ‘Wild Bull’ of the Pampas, before 80,000 people at the Polo Grounds in New York. Dempsey floored Firpo seven times, with Firpo knocking Dempsey clean out of the ring — and that was just the first round (there was no three knockdown rules back then. Indeed, Dempsey was allowed to stand over the fallen fighter and immediately knock Firpo down again, as there wasn’t a rule about going to a neutral corner either). Conspiracy theorists believe that Firpo was denied a valid victory in the first round as Dempsey was helped back into the ring by the writers at ringside and the referee was accused of counting incredibly slowly. Nevertheless, after 11 total knockdowns between the pair, Dempsey won by KO in the second. The fight was also important from a historical perspective because it was the first time that a Latin American boxer would fight for the world heavyweight title. ",

They were fighting to unify the World Welterweight Championship and the stakes couldn’t have been higher. First Hearns, then Leonard and then Hearns again held the lead. Between rounds 12 and 13, Leonard’s trainer, the legendary Angelo Dundee, exclaimed ‘You’re blowing it, son! You’re blowing it!’ Leonard simply exploded in the 13th, knocking Hearns through the ropes. He didn’t relent and finished him off in the 14th with a furious flurry of punches that forced referee Davey Pearl to call a halt to proceedings. Even worse for Hearns was that he was actually leading on all the judges’ scorecards up to that point. ",

Germany was the host nation.  They were still nursing over a 3-2 loss to Brazil in the 2002 Final.  They were considered one of the three best teams going into the Cup, and the group stage made them appear unstoppable, with several clear victories.  Italy on the other hand, was considered old, slow, and were lucky to even be in the semis.\n\nTo top it all off, Germany had NEVER lost an international match, cup or friendly, in the stadium the game was played in.  German fans made up approximately 80% of the crowd. Germany attacked relentlessly, outshooting the Italians 27-12 in regular time, though they failed to capitalize.  The match went into extra time.  Both teams had shots go off the crossbar in the et., but this one seemed destined for penalties.  But, in the 119th minute, one minute left to play (+2 min inj. time), Italy scored not one, but two goals.   Friends, I was at that game.  My dad's brother scored tickets, and the rich SOB flew us out to go with him.  The moment Grossi scored the winner, the 100,000+ crowd went SILENT.  Save for about 20K of us,  who one week later, would celebrate again.  But in retrospect, this is the game that made the tournament for me.",

Germany was still angry over their controversial 4-2 loss in the previous Cup's final to England.  Italy had not made a serious showing at a World Cup in several attempts, and hadn't won since 1938. But both entered with powerful squads, loaded both offensively and defensively. Italy scored in the sixth minute, and went on to turn away attack after attack by the Germans.  But then, in the 91st minute...well, you can guess. Yeah, they went to extra time. But what happened next was simply surreal. You see, the higher the level of soccer, the lower scoring the games (generally). 5 goals is an enormous amount for a game, but five goals in 21 minutes is ridiculous. Gerd Muller would twice give Germany the lead in the extra time, and twice Italy would tie it.  Then, in the 112th minute, Rivera scored for the Azurri, to give them the lead for good.  Today, the match is known throughout the soccer world as the Game of the Century.\n\nItaly was completely gassed, and unfortunately could not compete in the final, losing 4-1 against Brazil. It should be noted however that, regardless of how tired the Italians were, the 1970 Brazil team are considered the greatest football team ever to play.",

And because club soccer has almost zero nationality-related loyalty, I felt no need to cheer for them in the UEFA Final. Even more so, they were playing Liverpool, who my close friend loves with all her heart. So it was easy to decide who to root for. Unfortunately, Milan scored less than a minute in, and added 2 more before halftime. But in the second half, Liverpool bounced back, with 3 miraculous goals in six minutes. It was truly unbelievable to watch, especially considering how one of them JUST barely curved into the goal at the last second, and the other two were JUST out of the goalkeeper's hands. Extra time was exciting, as neither team really had quality placekickers, so neither wanted it to go to penalties.\n\nThree shots went off the crossbar, and Milan's goalie made an unbelievable save even I had to admit was impressive. Despite the team's best efforts however, it went to PKs. It was ugly, but Liverpool pulled it out 3-2 with a save on Milan's last shot.  The game' known as the Miracle in Istanbul, was the greatest club match I have ever seen. In 2007, the teams met again in the final, but with Milan winning 2-1. However, this time I was rooting for Milan, because Serie A needed the win to keep their place in the World Club Rankings. So between these two games, I got the best of both.",

    "directions" : "Remember when I said Brazil's 1970 team is considered the best ever? Well, their '82 game was even better. Sure, they had Pele in 1970, but he was getting old. In '82, Zico was in his prime, and currently the best player in the world. Their other players were also great, including stars such as Leandro, Junior, and Socrates, all in their prime. In their first 4 games, they scored 13 goals, allowing 2. Italy on the other hand, was a mess.  Goalkeeper Dino Zoff, at age 40, was only on the team because there wasn't anyone better. He had been a Top 10 all time several years prior, but now was much slower. Their best player, Paulo Rossi, was coming off a two-year suspension for gambling, and had yet to score in this cup. In the first group stage, Italy drew all three games, advancing only on goals scored. Back then, there was no Quarterfinals, but a knockout group stage. Four groups of three, the best in each advances to the semis. Italy got stuck with Brazil and Argentina, who had won the cup 4 years prior, and returned most of that squad (including superstar Maradona).\n\nA surprising victory over the Argentinians did not help, and they went into the match against Brazil needing a win.  Brazil needed only tie to advance. Rossi (ITA) scores in 5'. Socrates (BRA) scores in 12'. Rossi (ITA) in 25'. Falcao (BRA) in 68'. Every time Rossi scored, Brazil would answer. In the 74th minute, he scored a third time, completing the hat-trick, and giving Italy their third lead. That's all anyone seems to remember however. Lost to history are three miraculous saves by Zoff, two of them with less than five minutes to play. Despite their skill and best efforts, Brazil failed to equalize. Italy advanced with a 3-2 win. In the Semis, they defeated Poland 2-0. In that game, Rossi scored both goals.  Finally, remember the no.8 game on this list? Germany over France in '82? Yeah. Another Germany-Italy matchup. Guess how that ended? BTW-Rossi scored again. Rossi won both the Golden Ball (best player) and Golden Boot (Most goals-6) as Italy won their third World Cup. Dino Zoff is still the oldest player to ever win a World Cup. But none of it would have happened were it not for the greatest soccer match of all time.",
